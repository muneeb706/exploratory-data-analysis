# Data Incubator Challenges

Following is the list of challenges with description:
 - ## Coin Drawing
   Coins with values 1 through N (inclusive) are placed into a bag. 
   All the coins from the bag are iteratively drawn (without replacement) at random. 
   For the first coin, you are paid the value of the coin. 
   For subsequent coins, you are paid the absolute difference between the drawn coin and the previously drawn coin. 
   For example, if you drew 5,3,2,4,1, your payments would be 5,2,1,2,3 for a total payment of 13.

- ## Prescription Drug Coverage Analysis
  The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services publishes aggregate information on Medicare Part D Prescription Drug coverage. We will be investigating their "Provider Summary Table", which reports on the prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D for each health-care provider.
  The first questions will address only data from 2017. This table is available for download. The structure of the data is described in this document.
  The last two questions compare the 2017 data with 2016 data. The NPI code can be used to track providers across years.
